## What I did and what worked/didn't

I was inspired by the KAF website and used that to create my own food landing page. I made a picky eater food/resturant blog because I'm a picky eater and wished this existed. My site has 6 main components, and I was glad I got to incorporate my own images in it. I inspected KAF's page and found their layout to be intuitive so that definitely helped guide me. I think the way I laid it out ended up working well for the CSS I ended up implementing. I think the one thing that isn't so great on my site is the image resizing, especially for the mobile, but I wasn't quite sure how to fix that. Additionally my links, because href="#" always jump back to the top, but I would fix this if I went further with the website. 

## Some pictures!

### Layout stage

This is a picture of my blog in the only html stage. For the most part, I stuck with the content and layout, though I ended up needing to add a few more divs and changing some of the text as I was styling.

### Completed landing page

### Special stuff


#### Transitions

I went a little crazy with the transitions, and created one of my own.


#### Checkbox Hack

I was able to use CSS to make an expandable dropdown menu for the mobile version of my site.
